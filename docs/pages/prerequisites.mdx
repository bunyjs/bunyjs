# Prerequisites

Before getting started with BunyJS, ensure you have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A working knowledge of TypeScript is essential, especially its syntax, advanced features like decorators, and how it enhances JavaScript. BunyJS is built with TypeScript-first principles, leveraging its powerful type system for robust development.
  - [experimentalDecorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#experimentalDecorators): Enable the `experimentalDecorators` compiler option in your `tsconfig.json` to use TypeScript decorators with BunyJS.
  - [emitDecoratorMetadata](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#emitDecoratorMetadata): Enable the `emitDecoratorMetadata` compiler option in your `tsconfig.json` to emit design-type metadata for decorators.
- [Event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture): Familiarity with event-driven programming concepts, such as lifecycle events and event coordination, will help you grasp BunyJSâ€™s event-centric approach to managing module interactions.
- [Inversion of Control (IoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control): Understanding the IoC principle is critical. It allows BunyJS to manage dependencies using a centralized container, enabling modularity and flexibility in your applications.
- [Dependency Injection (DI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection): Knowledge of DI patterns is key to understanding how BunyJS promotes loose coupling by dynamically resolving and injecting dependencies into your components through its IoC container.
